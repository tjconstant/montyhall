# MontyHall

MontyHall is an example of solving a probability puzzle [The Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) using repeated random sampling ([The Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)) in R.

From Parade magazine in 1990 (as quoted on wikipedia):

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
